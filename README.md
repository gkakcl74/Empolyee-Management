# Empolyee-Management-cpp

### @ The code of this program is very inefficient.
#### @ It's still a very unstable program.


You can refer to it, but I don't recommend copying it.
It's just a backup of files.

But I will develop this program and make a proper program.
Currently, it is version 1, and we will continue to develop efficiency and design in the future.

<hr/>

#### @ This program is an employee management program.
Employee data can be imported into a text file.

### @The file must be saved C:\\data\\sawon.txt or siljuk.txt

sawon.txt is Save the employee's profile

ex) 2021001 choidongmin 1salesteam

The employee number and name department name are in order.

<hr/>

siljuck is We store our performance

ex) 2021001 30 40 50 60
